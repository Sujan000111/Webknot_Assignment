# Campus Event Management Platform --Sujan J (1MJ21IS106)

## What This Project Does

I am creating a campus management portal,
The system has two main parts:
1. A web portal where college staff create and manage events
2. A mobile app where students discover and register for events

## My Understanding of the Problem

The event managment is a biggest headache for the colleges , so ao for the problem, i will be creating a simiplified solution. The web portal for teachers for similpified management and mobile app for the students.

## How I Approached This

### The Database Design
For the Datbase, I am using a supabase-postgres sql.

### The Tech Stack
I chose technologies I'm comfortable with and that get the job done:
- **Supabase-postgres** for the database and auth,it handles the boring stuff so I can focus on features
- **React** for the web portal,familiar and has great tooling
- **React Native** for the mobiLe app,lets me target both iOS and Android without doubling the work and have experience dealing with it.

### The User Experience
I tried to make this feel natural for both groups:
- Staff get a proper dashboard with all the data they need
- Students get a mobile-first experience that's quick and easy
- Both sides see the same data, just presented differently

## What I Built

### Core Features That Work
- **Event Creation**: Staff can create events with all the details students need
- **Registration System**: Students can register with one tap, staff see numbers in real-time
- **Feedback Collection**: Simple 1-5 star rating plus optional comments
- **Basic Reports**: The three reports mentioned in the assignment


## The Reports I Built

These were specifically requested in the assignment:

1. **Event Popularity Report**: Shows events sorted by registration count, plus attendance rates and feedback scores
2. **Student Participation Report**: Shows how active each student is across all events
3. **Top 3 Most Active Students**: Leaderboard of students who attend the most events
